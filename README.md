# Learning
Here is where I begin my language and key concept learning

## Languages
I Really like systems programming and so i want to begin my journey into more low level and non web based programming. I plan on doing languages like C, Rust, C++, C#, java, go and zig.
Probably wont get around to all the languages but a man can dream.
